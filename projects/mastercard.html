            <p><b>Challenge</b>
                <br>Users are impressed by our powerful macroeconomic data, but they are not sure how to cherry pick the most important piece and how to digest it for their own business problem. 
                We want to help them with that, inspiring them with insights.
                <br><br>
                What kind of insights users want? How do they utilize it? And how do we deliver it? I lead discovery throughout the year to drive customer value with insights, and design a scalable insight mechanism for global audience.</p>
            <p><b>Brainstorm, pilot, and build things on top of things</b>
                <br>Our product is in Market Test, we aspire to be agile and test out ideas fast. 
                <br><br>
                I facilitate cross-functional brainstorm,  consolidate distinct ideas into low-fidelity prototypes, run user research to define needs, pilot in low cost ways to a boarder audience to validate effectiveness of design. 
                Because of this agile design&development approach, we were able to scale, pivot and kill ideas, and build things on top of things.
                <br><br>
                <b>Impact</b>
                <br>While we are still exploring the insights space, usage data are helping us to validate and gauge the success of design solutions. While the static insight PDF in 2020 only reached ~20% active users weekly, the new platform insights tab is consistently interacted with by 75-85% users, tying the SpendingPulse product image with quality macroeconomic insights.
                <br><br>
                Our “pilot first” approach is shared broadly across organization, impacting design practices for all nascent products.

            <p><b>Sketch to Figma</b>
                <br>While our team migrates from Sketch to Figma, I took the opportunities to reconstruct our table and data visualization components. For end users, I aimed at better readability and usability; for fellow designers, I constructed easy to use and flexible components for different use cases.<br><br>
                <b>UX audit: Design, Plan, Execute</b>
                <br> I collaborated with a senior visual designer to drive a UX audit , aligning SpendingPulse to D&SE design system.
                <br><br>At the design phase, our objective was to find out which components is inconsistent with D&SE and how they should be updated. 
                Moving on to the plan phase, we worked closely with PMs and engineers to insert proposed design updates onto product team roadmaps.
                While executing, I advocate weekly to pull in quick wins and serve as an expert of all things design system.</p>

            <p><b>Challenge</b>
                <br> MMI product team is realizing the importance of user experience. However, they never worked with a UX designer before, and they don’t know how to start making “better UX”. 
                <br><br>
                <b>Define, evaluate, prioritize, and educate</b>
                <br> Our UX team rarely support an internal consulting project. Partnered with a senior designer, I served as a UX consultant.
                <br><br>With limited research resource, we kicked off by distilling user insights from previous 3rd party agency research and a holistic heuristic evaluation.
                <br><br>We prioritized the onboarding flow, dashboard screen, and key data visualization to align D&S best practice with a focus in making it easy to digest and actionable for small business owners.
                <br><br>I also initiated new team process to educate and integrate design thinking into day-to-day product work, and provide UX perspective to all new front-end features in the backlog.
                <br><br>
                <b>Impact</b>
                <br>With our involvement in 2021, MMI built 10+ front-end enhancements, enabled 9 new metrics, and reimagined the future of the platform with design thinking. 
                <br><br>Transforming a technology-focused culture to user-focused can be hard, and MMI team took a solid first step. The UX improvement was so significant that it gained senior stakeholder recognitions, and budgets for an embedded UX designer.
